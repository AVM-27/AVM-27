My work lives at the nexus of semiconductor design and artificial intelligence. I specialize in hardware-software co-design to accelerate compute-intensive workloads, whether it's designing custom logic for an SoC or optimizing inference pipelines at data center scale. I thrive on the challenge of maximizing performance-per-watt ($TOPS/W$) and minimizing latency for the next generation of AI applications.

---

### 🧭 My Mission

My goal is to architect and design the next generation of custom silicon—ASICs, FPGAs, and SoCs—that will power AI and high-performance computing in the data center and at the intelligent edge. I'm driven to solve fundamental challenges in memory bandwidth, interconnects, and power-efficient compute.
