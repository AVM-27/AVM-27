## 🧠 About Me

I'm a final-year Electronics Engineering student focused on building high-performance compute hardware that powers smarter AI.  
My interests lie in hardware-software co-design—designing custom RTL, accelerating inference with FPGAs, and deploying optimised AI pipelines on heterogeneous edge platforms.  
I’m driven to push performance-per-watt boundaries through smart logic design and silicon-aware AI.

---

## 🧭 My Mission

To architect the next generation of compute silicon—SoCs, ASICs, and FPGAs—that accelerate intelligent workloads at the edge.  
I aim to solve design challenges in memory bottlenecks, interconnect latency, and energy-efficient inference with creative, low-level engineering.
