I'm on a mission to blur the lines between hardware and software until they're inseparable. As a final-year student, I get my hands dirty with everything from low-level RTL design to high-flying FPGA-based AI. I'm currently looking for my next adventure and am open to **internship and collaboration opportunities** where I can help build the future of computing.

### 🧭 Where I’m Headed

I'm aiming to work at the intersection of RTL, hardware acceleration, and embedded AI—where systems aren’t just functional, they’re fast and intelligent. Long-term, I want to contribute to high-performance chip designs powering edge-AI and next-gen computing.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

Before I made chips think, I was a **4× National Champion in competitive word games**.  
Turns out I just enjoy making things process language — whether they’re human or silicon.

Would you like me to:
- export this as a downloadable `README.md` file?
- generate a recruiter-specific variant for FPGA/VLSI?
- help deploy self-hosted GitHub stats for private activity?

Let me know.
