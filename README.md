I'm on a mission to blur the lines between hardware and software until they're inseparable. As a final-year student, I get my hands dirty with everything from low-level RTL design to high-flying FPGA-based AI. I'm currently looking for my next adventure and am open to **internship and collaboration opportunities** where I can help build the future of computing.

### 🔭 Current Quests

- 🧠 **Project SATARK (Smart India Hackathon):** Teaching an FPGA to have superhuman hearing for real-time gunshot detection.
- 🛡️ **Waging War on Noise:** Wielding MATLAB & LabVIEW to model and reduce phase noise in radar systems.
- 🎥 **AI Video Detective:** Building an ML pipeline to spot forged footage in UAV/dashcam feeds.
- 🌱 **Endless Exploration:** Going down the rabbit holes of HLS, custom IP design, and AI on tiny embedded devices.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

Before I made chips think, I was a **4× National Champion in competitive word games**.
Turns out I just enjoy making things process language — whether they’re human or silicon.
